        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin 
        in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. 
        (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug came and took it.) 
        Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, 
        Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. 
        Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. 
        The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other 
        business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had

            <h3>Thorin II Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain.
                 Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug
                  in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he 
                  participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath 
                  the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch
                   found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. 
                They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór.
                 Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves 
                 in Thorin's company.

            <h3>Oin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin, the
                father of Balin and Dwalin.            
                Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's company on the
                quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would
                come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing
                the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the group. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five
                Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the
                company of Thorin.

            <p>
                Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and younger
                brother of Óin.            
                In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves
                and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.            
                In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In March of TA
                2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so
                that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin referred them as "simpletons" and also
                said that Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell".
